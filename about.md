I’m a machine learning engineer who likes making models _useful_: clean training/eval pipelines, fast and reliable serving, and clear metrics.

Recently:
- Built a real-time anonymization system on NVIDIA Jetson (SCRFD + TensorRT); ~24 FPS at 640×480 with micro/macro evaluation.
- Created an evaluation harness against SAM with Dice/Recall and environment/face-count aggregates.
- Previously, shipped data systems at Econ One (PostgreSQL platform, multithreaded processing, accurate billing integrations).
